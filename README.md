Study of tools to predict and optimize the performances of modern computer architectures, that are characterized by a high level of parallelism,
sharing and dynamic allocation of computational and storage resources, centralized and distributed components, exascale dimensions of resources and users, and a high variability of requests.

- Introduction to performance indices and measures
- Workload and Service characterization
- Analytical models
- Simulation and resource contention

This repository contains all the practical assignments during the "Performance Evaluation and Applications" course at Polimi and also a final project.
